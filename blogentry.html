            <p>HTML is very important in the development and deployment of web based games.  These games are ones that are able to run 
                the browser that the user has.  HTML isn't the only language you need to know.  CSS and JavaScript are also very important
                to integrate into HTML.  These are both in front end developement of the game.<br><br>

                Because, browsers are updated regularly, the developer can assume that the browser is up to date.  Therefore, the game can 
                easily run without any issues.  Also, Canvas is used to develop games in the CSS file.  Also, HTML games can be ran on any
                modern device because HTML is used on every page of the Internet. <a href="https://medium.com/henngeblog/html5-game-development-part-1-c2e8a2e2a2b5"
