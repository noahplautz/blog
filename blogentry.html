            <p>Adding scroll snapping can add different perspectives and dimensions within your website.  Besides scrolling vertically, you can post content
                for the user to scroll horizontally.  This can allow the creator to add content in a more organized manner.  Different forms of scroll snapping allow
                the content to automatically go to the correct position and not cut off any content.  The first scroll is an example of scroll snapping.  You can see the
                scroll snapping when the edges of the different colored numbers reaches the barrier it, snaps into place when let go with the mouse.  The other example is 
                no scroll snapping.  Also, the version of Chrome that I am running doesn't have support for this but Microsoft Edge does.

            <p>Responsive imagery is important because the size of the screen and image could greatly impact the display of the webpage.  There is a difference
                between resposnive webpages and tailoring the image based upon the screen size. If there is no responsive images, the load time on the phone could be
                extremely long.  A good variable for responsive webpages is vw.  View window changes the size of the image based upon the percentage of window open.<br>
                Tailoring the image is changing the image based upon exact lengths.  For example when width reaches 440px, the image goes to certain width.  Then when 
                it gets to another threshold, width changes again.<br>
                These are examples of responsive width based upon the width of the window.  First image uses vw and the second image uses px and media tag.

            <p>Slide shows a perfect way to show images in a neat and orderly fashion.  In HTML, you can create a slideshow that needs the user input
                to change the slides with a caption at the bottom of the image.  But, you can also do a slideshow and with some extra JavaScript code, you can
                have the slideshow automatically flip on a timer.

                There also multiple different styles of slideshows you can have.  You can have different types of buttons that look different.

            <p>Just like in Java, you can create buttons on your webpage to interact with the user.  These buttons can offer many different
                things that the user can do.  For example you can have a button that allows the user to submit a document or application online.
                You can also have buttons to switch between webpages.  Google uses html buttons to search for results.  Buttons are implemented with
                the button html tag.

                There also many different types of buttons.  You have type button which is any ordinary button, reset button which clears the form of 
                any input from the user and the submit button for submitting information.  Here are some examples of buttons.
                <button type="button" style="color: red;">Submit</button>
                <button type="reset">Clear</button>

        <p>HTML is very important in the development and deployment of web based games.  These games are ones that are able to run 
            the browser that the user has.  HTML isn't the only language you need to know.  CSS and JavaScript are also very important
            to integrate into HTML.  These are both in front end developement of the game.<br><br>

            Because, browsers are updated regularly, the developer can assume that the browser is up to date.  Therefore, the game can 
            easily run without any issues.  Also, Canvas is used to develop games in the CSS file.  Also, HTML games can be ran on any
            modern device because HTML is used on every page of the Internet. <a href="https://medium.com/henngeblog/html5-game-development-part-1-c2e8a2e2a2b5"
