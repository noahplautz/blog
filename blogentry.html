            <p>Just like in Java, you can create buttons on your webpage to interact with the user.  These buttons can offer many different
                things that the user can do.  For example you can have a button that allows the user to submit a document or application online.
                You can also have buttons to switch between webpages.  Google uses html buttons to search for results.  Buttons are implemented with
                the button html tag.

                There also many different types of buttons.  You have type button which is any ordinary button, reset button which clears the form of 
                any input from the user and the submit button for submitting information.  Here are some examples of buttons.
                <button type="button" style="color: red;">Submit</button>
                <button type="reset">Clear</button>

        <p>HTML is very important in the development and deployment of web based games.  These games are ones that are able to run 
            the browser that the user has.  HTML isn't the only language you need to know.  CSS and JavaScript are also very important
            to integrate into HTML.  These are both in front end developement of the game.<br><br>

            Because, browsers are updated regularly, the developer can assume that the browser is up to date.  Therefore, the game can 
            easily run without any issues.  Also, Canvas is used to develop games in the CSS file.  Also, HTML games can be ran on any
            modern device because HTML is used on every page of the Internet. <a href="https://medium.com/henngeblog/html5-game-development-part-1-c2e8a2e2a2b5"
